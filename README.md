This is the code corresponding to my attempt in the "Kaggle NLP Twitter (X.com) Competition"

This work was my first experience with NLP tasks and working with .txt files in Python. I used the previously available API for Twitter and trained a support vector classifier to predict the sentiment of a given tweet. 
To achieve that I spent most of my time tokenizing the words and input data and then applied several different non-linear and linear models to find the one that describe the training data the best and submitted my results.
