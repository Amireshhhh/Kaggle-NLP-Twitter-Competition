This is the code corresponding to my attempt in the "Kaggle NLP Twitter (X.xom) Competition"

This work was my first experience with NLP taks and working with .txt files in Python. I used the previously available API for Twitter and trained a support vector classifier to predicit the sentiment of a given tweet. 
In order to achieve that I spent most of my time to tokenize the words and input data and then applied several different non-linear and linear models to find the one that describe the training data the best and submitted my results.
